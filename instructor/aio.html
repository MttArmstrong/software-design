<div class="section level1">
<h1 id="what-is-software-design">What is Software Design?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-software-design"></a>
</h1>
<p>Before we start talking about software design, let’s clarify what
that actually means and when you should start thinking about it. You
might have written a couple of Jupyther notebook cells before, or a
script or two, or maybe you’ve developed a package, or even a web
application. All of these things need to be “designed” in the sense that
you need to make decisions about where what code goes, how the code
flows, or how the user will use your code. While there will likely be
fewer design considerations going into creating a Jupyter notebook than
into writing a complete web application, that doesn’t mean you don’t
need to think about design when creating a few Jupyter cells. If your
code is well-designed, it is easier to read, easier to maintain, and
easier to sustain in the long-run; either by you or by someone else.</p>
<p>There are many aspects that feed into designing software and your
design choices can affect other components of the software development
life cycle. For instance, if you don’t modularize your code, it is a lot
harder and potentially impossible to write well-defined tests.
Throughout this module, there will be references to other modules with
more specific details on a topic. Not every aspect is relevant to every
project, but that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t all be considered at some
point (even if it’s just to decide to focus on something else).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level1">
<h1 id="technical-debt">Technical Debt<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#technical-debt"></a>
</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“In software development and other information technology fields,
technical debt […] is the implied cost of future reworking required when
choosing an easy but limited solution instead of a better approach that
could take more time.”</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt" class="external-link">Wikipedia -
Technical Debt</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, there is not time like the present. If ones chooses saving
time over creating a better solution that would require a greater time
investment, one accumlutes technical debt. For example, it could be
faster to hard-code the paths to files required by a script at the
locations when they are needed rather than defining variables at the
beginning of a script and use the variables throughout the code. While
the first approach would likely be easier and faster at the time of
writing the script, it would make it harder to change the file paths for
the next project or dataset and require extra work to rewrite the code
to enable it to be more flexible.</p>
<p>Technical debt can accumulate at every level of a piece of software
from hard-coding strings, to modularizing code, to choosing a database
that’s faster to set up but has limited storage capabilities. An
important skill for a developer is to recognize when technical debt is
accrued and to understand if the effort necessary to pay it down in the
future is worth the time saved at present.</p>
<p>Technical debt and software design are interlinked as the better a
piece of software is designed, the lower the technical debt typically
is. Often a more flexible design takes more time to implement and can be
more complex. Hence, it can be tempting to choose a simpler design or to
choose to postpone reworking code in favor of quickly finishing a
feature. In many cases, however, this leads to a greater time investment
in the future.</p>

<div class="section level1">
<h1 id="the-different-layers-of-software-design">The Different Layers of Software Design<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-different-layers-of-software-design"></a>
</h1>
<p>Software can consist of many different layers. From writing a couple
of lines of code to architecting distributed systems, in each layer the
relationship between the different components need to be defined and
implemented. For the purpose of this lesson, we will take a holistic
perspective on software design and group the concepts and best practices
into three layers as follows.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="layer-1-instructions">Layer 1: Instructions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#layer-1-instructions"></a>
</h2>
<p>This is the smallest unit of coding: writing instructions that the
computer understands. In this context, software design refers to how
“things” are named, the code style employed, and how code is broken up
into functions and methods. While not everybody might agree that this
falls under software design, the decisions you make on this level can
have consequences for the whole software.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="layer-2-structure-and-organization">Layer 2: Structure and Organization<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#layer-2-structure-and-organization"></a>
</h2>
<p>In this layer, we need to think about where we put the different
parts of our code. Questions such as “who can access what functions” or
“where does certain functionality belong to” are considered here.
Classes or modules can be used to organize code, and considerations
about their definition are made here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="layer-3-components-and-services">Layer 3: Components and Services<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#layer-3-components-and-services"></a>
</h2>
<p>On the highest level, decisions about how different applications and
systems talk to each other and how they exchange information are being
made. It can also include how the different components of an application
are connected. We will not talk much about this layer, but if the
applications you develop get to a certain point it should be something
you think about.</p>

<div class="section level1">
<h1 id="layer-1-instructions">Layer 1: Instructions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#layer-1-instructions"></a>
</h1>
<p>In 2008, Robert C. Martin published his book “Clean Code: A Handbook
of Agile Software Craftsmanship”. In this book he lists a set of best
practices to write maintainable and sustainable code. We will talk about
some of these best practices that are generally very useful. There are a
lot of resources out there on clean code if you want to learn more,
however, keep in mind that everything has a context and not every
recommendation or best practices fits in every situation.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="naming-things">Naming Things<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#naming-things"></a>
</h2>
<p><a href="https://geek-and-poke.com/geekandpoke/2015/1/12/what-every-good-system-needs" class="external-link"><img src="../fig/geek-poke-typo2.jpeg" style="float:right; width:350px" alt="Geek &amp; Poke - What every good system needs" class="figure"></a></p>
<p>Naming things is one of the hardest things in programming: you want
to use names that are descriptive but not too long. It’s an art. What
you should absolutely avoid are variable names like <code>a</code>,
<code>b</code>, or <code>c</code> and function names like
<code>myfunction</code> or <code>do_this</code>. There are a few
exceptions, for example, it can be ok to call your counter in a for-loop
<code>i</code> but even in those cases there is usually a better
name.</p>
<p>Another good rule to follow is to use verbs for functions and
methods, for example name your function <code>calculate</code> rather
than <code>calculation</code>, or <code>retrieve_data</code> instead of
<code>data</code>. Variable names on the other hand are usually nouns
potentially modified by an adjective, such as <code>language</code> or
<code>color</code>. If you have boolean variables, those are often
adjectives or adjectives with the “is”-prefix such as <code>blue</code>
or <code>is_blue</code> (this in part depends on the programming
language you are using).</p>
<p>Lastly, the use of keywords as names should be absolutely avoided.
There are few exceptions where it is ok to use a reserved keyword as a
name, but those are few and far between. Some programming languages
won’t let you use reserved keywords as names, however, some do (Python
being one of them). For instance, in Python if you name a variable
<code>type</code>, then the method <code>type()</code> will be
overwritten and not be available anymore, which can lead in the best
case scenario to your program erroring out and in the worst case to
produce incorrect results.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="searchability">Searchability<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#searchability"></a>
</h2>
<p>A consideration that should go into naming things should be how well
the name would be found if someone searches your code. If you choose
function names that have nothing to do with what the functions are
doing, it is difficult to find the relevant pieces of code when one is
not familiar with it. For instance, if a function that queries a list of
temperatures and calculates their average is called
<code>return_value</code> then searching for “average” or “temperature”
won’t bring up that method. Similarly, if there are spelling mistakes in
names, searches cannot find those either (e.g. if you call a method
<code>calculate_averge</code> instead of
<code>calculate_average</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="consistency">Consistency<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#consistency"></a>
</h2>
<p>Be consistent! Once you decide on how to do something, stick to it.
For example, if you decide to call functions that retrieve values
<code>get_value</code> (where “value” stands for the name of the
variable the function retrieves) then don’t start calling them
<code>retrieve_value</code> half-way through your program. This applies
to all levels of development. For instance, if you choose to use
type-hints in Python use them consistently throughout your project, not
just in one file. Or if you choose to have one file per component then
apply this strategy to your whole project. Inconsistent code is much
harder to understand, which makes it a lot harder to maintain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="indentation">Indentation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#indentation"></a>
</h2>
<p>Indentation is an important factor of code readability. So important
that in Python, it is part of the syntax of the language. No matter what
programming language you use, choose how you indent your blocks
(e.g. will you use tabs or blanks, how many blanks will be one level of
indentation) and then stick to it. This code:</p>
<pre><code>function hello() {
console.log("Hello World!");
saidHello()
if saidHelloTwice(){
console.log("Goodbye")}
}</code></pre>
<p>is much less readable than:</p>
<pre><code>function hello() {
    console.log("Hello World!");
    saidHello()
    if saidHelloTwice(){
        console.log("Goodbye")
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>If you use an integrated development environment (IDE) such as VSCode
it will come with some functionality to help you with that. It pays off
to make the time to figure out how to set it up in the beginning of your
project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="magic-numberes">Magic Numberes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#magic-numberes"></a>
</h2>
<p>Try to avoid magic numbers. Magic numbers are typically hard-coded
numbers (or strings) that you use throughout your code, e.g. you might
use Pi by putting 3.14 in multiple places of your code. These values
should be put into constants, preferably at the beginning of your code
or in a separate file. If you or someone else wants to change one value
they should be able to go to one place and change it only once. You
don’t want to hunt through all code files to find all the places that a
certain number is used. Most languages have conventions on how to format
constant names (e.g. all uppercase letters) to make it visually clear
that a variable is a constant that shouldn’t be changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="the-principle-of-least-astonishment">The Principle of Least Astonishment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-principle-of-least-astonishment"></a>
</h2>
<p>The principle of least astonishment (or least surprise) basically
says that a user (or another developer in the case of code) should not
be astonished (or surprised) when using a specific functionality. For
programming specifically this means that for example a function should
behave according to their name or a variable should hold a value that
makes sense given their name. To name a few examples, if a function is
called <code>calculate_average()</code> it should actually calculate the
average and not the mean, or if it is called <code>get_age()</code> then
it should return the age and not the name of a person. Similarly, a
variable called <code>temperature_celsius</code> should hold the
temperate in Celsius not in Fahrenheit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="one-line-should-not-do-too-many-things">One Line Should Not Do Too Many Things<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#one-line-should-not-do-too-many-things"></a>
</h2>
<p>Try to keep your lines short(-ish) and let one line of code not do
too many things. Except in the case of method chaining
(<code>obj.method1().method2().method3()</code>), a line should
typically do only one or two things. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>door = street.houses[0].open() if street.houses[0] and (street.houses[0].is_inhabited() or street.houses[0].is_empty()) else street.move_in().door()</code></pre>
<p>There is a lot going on in this one line, which makes it hard to
understand. The following is much easier to read:</p>
<pre><code>if street.houses[0] and (street.houses[0].is_inhabited() or street.houses[0].is_empty()):
   door = street.houses[0].open()
else:
   door = street.move_in().door()</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="commenting-and-documentation">Commenting and Documentation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#commenting-and-documentation"></a>
</h2>
<p>Commenting and documentation are its own topic and deserve a lot more
attention than this one short pargraph, but for completeness, here are a
few recommendations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t comment the obvious.</strong> For instance, the
following comment is not particularly helpful:
<code># initializing all the lists     cars = []     drivers = []</code>
It’s clear from the code what’s happening. The following edited version
is better.</p>
<pre><code># The following two lists keep the currently available cars
# and the drivers who need a car.
cars = []
drivers = []</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Explain the why rather than the how.</strong> For
example, instead of commenting that you are adding one to the counter,
say why you are doing this (unless it’s obvious from your
code).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explain the things you might not understand in the
future</strong> (an hour, a day, a month… from now) or that might not be
clear to other people who read your code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explain your design decisions</strong> if it’s not
obvious from your code (e.g. why did you use an integer flag and not a
boolean).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explain why other obvious solutions do not work or you
didn’t choose them.</strong> Keep in mind that your code is not for
professional developers and therefore a little bit more detailed
comments might be justified.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Delete old code, do not just comment it out.</strong>
When you comment out code that you don’t need anymore instead of
removing it, you clutter your code making it harder to pick out the
important comments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adhere to the standards of the programming
language.</strong> This will on the one hand make it easier for other
people who are used to the standard to read and understand your code. On
the other hand, this will allow you to leverage tools such as the ones
that are included with your IDE of choice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure your comments are correct.</strong> This might
seem obvious but make sure that if you change your code after you
commented it that you also adjust your comments. There is nothing more
confusing than a comment that the next line does X when it actually does
Y.</p></li>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>You might finds statements like the following on website and other
programming best practices resources: * “Self-documenting code is code
that doesn’t require code comments for a human to understand its naming
conventions and what it is doing.”
<br><a href="https://hackbrightacademy.com/blog/writing-self-documenting-code/" class="external-link">Source:

be so clear and readable that he simply does not need any
documentation.”

<p>While it is true that your code should ideally tell the reader
something about its purpose through its structure, and variable and
function naming, there still need to be comments and documentation to
make it understandable and maintainable. The intention of the programmer
and the answer to the question “why was this code written the way it is”
can in most cases not be conveyed through naming and structure
alone.</p>

<span><span class="fu">print</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"Hello "</span>, <span class="va">person_2</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="fu">print</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"Hello "</span>, <span class="va">person_3</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Instead of copying these three lines and paste them everywhere you
want to use them, you can create a function for that and then just call
the function.</p>
<pre><code>def print_hellos():
   print("Hello ", person_1)
   print("Hello ", person_2)
   print("Hello ", person_3)</code></pre>
<p>You can now whenever you want to print the hellos simply use
<code>print_hellos()</code>. Functions are a great way to structure your
code. They let you keep code together that belongs together and name it,
which not only helps making clear what the code is for but also it makes
it easily reusable.</p>
<p>Functions are a great way to structure your code. They let you keep
code together that belongs together and name it, which not only helps
making clear what the code is for but also it makes it easily
reusable.</p>
<p>When writing functions, however, keep the following guidelines in
mind: - <strong>Keep them small and simple</strong>: the shorter and
simpler a function is, the easier it is maintain and to understand. -
<strong>One function, one purpose</strong>: a function should only do
one thing, e.g. don’t write a function that reads from a file, analyzes
it, and then writes to a file. Instead, have one function to read from a
file, one function to analyze the data, and one function to write to a
file. - <strong>Prefer fewer arguments</strong>: the more arguments a
function has, the harder it is to understand and maintain it. -
<strong>Avoid side effects</strong>: your functions should be structured
and written in a way that they do not produce side effects, meaning if
you change a function only the function should be impacted. For
instance, global variable use is notorious in regards to creating side
effects. If your function changes a global variable, then it becomes
likely that changes in the function impact other places of your code
where you use the global variable - <strong>Avoid flag
arguments</strong>: flag arguments are arguments that hold either
true/false values or integers that control the flow of the function. If
you pass a parameter (e.g. isRetired) to a function and the only point
of the parameter is to use it in an if/else block to control what logic
should be executed (e.g. get retirement rate or get the salary of a
person) then there is usually a better approach (e.g. creating one
function for retirees and one for people still working).</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The DRY principle stands for “Don’t Repeat Yourself.” It means that
if you have multiple lines of code that are duplicates of each other
then they should be replaced by, for instance, functions. A good
indicator that your code could be “DRYier” is if you copy-paste code
from one place to another. Using the same code in multiple places by
duplicated it means that if you find a bug you have to hunt down all the
duplicates and fix it there as well. If you use a function instead, you
only have to fix the function (in one place).</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Spaghetti code is code without any structure or modularization. Often
that means there are no or few functions or classes to structure your

Spaghetti code is almost impossible to maintain once it reaches a

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Configurations should be all kept in one place. For instance if a

(e.g. model parameterizations), then those should be ideally kept in one
file named in a way that it is obvious what it contains (e.g. “config”
or “configuration”). This way a programmer only needs to find one file
to set up a program rather than hunting through the code to find all
hard-coded paths and other configurations.</p>

Depending on your programming language that can be the same file, or the

<p>Most programming languages offer a lot of utility functions and
solutions for commonly encountered problems. While it takes a lot of
time to learn every feature of a programming language, you should first
check what solutions are part of the basic functionality of the
programming language you are using before implementing your own
solution. For instance, if you need to solve a common math problem,
first check if your programming language has a math package and if it
includes a function that does what you need before implementing your
own.</p>

<p>Dependency hell refers to the situation in which your code depends on
a number of other packages (dependencies) that themselves depend on
other packages that depend on other packages, and so on. Some of your
dependencies might use the same packages as some other dependencies but
a different version of them. Or maybe the dependencies you are using are
only available for an outdated version of the programming language you
are using and that keeps you from upgrading your code. The more
dependencies your code has, the more complex and harder to update it
becomes. Therefore, you should carefully choose any package your code
<em>depends</em> on.</p>
<p>When you choose to use another package, first check who maintains
that package and when it was last updated. Is it actively maintained and
has a community that reports bugs and makes pull requests? Is it
potentially backed by a company? How long has it been since the last
release and the last commit? Does the maintainer respond to issues
created? By answering these questions, you will get a better sense of
how actively maintained the package is. If there hasn’t been much
activity in the last few weeks or months, it might be an indicator that
the package has been abandoned or will be soon. In that case, you want
to be careful about depending on it in your code. If there is not much
activity but you still want to use a certain package, then you should be
prepared to maintain a fork of the package yourself should it become
necessary.</p>

<h2 id="code-coupling">Code Coupling<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#code-coupling"></a>
</h2>
<p>In software development, “coupling” refers to how two pieces of code
are connected with each other. Coupling happens on a scale from tight to
loosely. The tighter two parts of a system are coupled, the more they
need to know about each other.</p>
<p>Cleancommit.io defines loose coupling like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In a loosely coupled system, the components are independent of each
other. Each component has its own well-defined interface and
communicates with other components through standardized protocols.
Changes to one component do not require changes to other components,
making the system more flexible and easier to maintain.”</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://cleancommit.io/blog/whats-the-difference-between-tight-and-loose-coupling/" class="external-link">cleancommit.io</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tight coupling is the opposite of loose coupling, which means that
when you change one component you need to change the other one as well
to adapt it to the changes of the first component.</p>
<p>Coupling happens everywhere. Between modules, between classes,
between layers, between components, and between whole systems. In a
well-designed system, things that logically belong together will be kept
together (<em>cohesion</em>) and the different components don’t know
much about the inner workings of each other but communicate over clearly
defined interfaces (<em>coupling</em>).</p>
<p>As an example, look at the following code and think about why this is
tightly coupled. How could it be more loosely coupled? Then check the
discussion below.</p>

the two numbers and prints the result. The means of retrieving the two

this function if wanted the numbers to come from somewhere (e.g. a
different calculation). This function can only be used in one scenario,

</h2>
<p>You might be wondering how you can know if something is tightly
coupled. In theory, it is fairly easy to find out, just ask the
following question: If I want to replace component A, do I need to
change component B a lot?</p>
<p>If the answer is yes, then your two components are tightly coupled.
If the answer is no, then they are loosely coupled. There are degrees of
tight coupling, some components are more tightly coupled than others.
Similarly, some components are more loosely coupled than others. You
won’t always achieve the loosest coupling possible, nor is it always
recommendable. This is because, in many cases, coupling two components
more loosely comes with the cost of more complexity. And the more
complexity there is, the harder it can be to maintain your code.</p>
<p>For instance, look at the following piece of code, does it look
familiar?</p>

<p>This is the same code from before that adds two numbers. However, it
is as loosely coupled as it can be. The different pieces of code are not
only loosely coupled to each other, but the code is also loosely coupled
to its purpose. It doesn’t have to be two numbers anymore that are being
added but can be however many numbers need to be summed up. However, the
code got considerably longer and it is a lot harder to understand its
purpose. Therefore, you should always ask yourself, do I need my code to
be more loosely coupled or more generalized or is this the right balance
between loose coupling and understandability?</p>

<p>The goal of many software engineering best practices is to loosely

list of techniques that aim to decouple code (make it more loosely
coupled).</p>

<h2 id="information-hiding">Information Hiding<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#information-hiding"></a>
</h2>
<p><em>Information hiding</em>, or sometimes also referred to as
<em>encapsulation</em>, describes the practice of “hiding” the inner
workings of a piece of code from whoever calls it. The goal of this
technique is to avoid that one has to change the caller when the callee
is changed. If calling function A requires knowledge about how A is
implemented, it not only tightly couples function A with the code that
calls it, it also makes it more difficult to understand the code as
looking at the function name and its parameters does not provide all the
details needed to use function A.</p>
<p>Some programming languages (like Java or C#) provide means of hiding
information that are part of the standard curriculum when the language
is taught. Other languages (like Python) offer no or only limited
support. Especially in these cases, it is important to learn the
standard coding conventions of the language and follow them.</p>
<p>As an example for information hiding, let’s look at the following
piece of code. There are two files, one that defines the function
<code>say_something</code> and one that uses it. If you want to change
the animal that makes the sound, you need to know that there is a global
variable in <code>sound.py</code> that you need to change.</p>

<p>The following piece of code hides the information about the global
variable. Instead, a function parameter is added that you can use to set
the animal. If the implementation of <code>say_something_animal</code>
changes to for example set a global variable to the passed in value,
then the call in <code>script.py</code> does not have to change at all.
The internal workings of <code>say_something_animal</code> stay
completely hidden.</p>

<p>More often information hiding is talked about in the context of
object-oriented programming. In the following example, knowledge about
the internal workings of the class are required to use the class:</p>

<h2 id="abstraction">Abstraction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#abstraction"></a>
</h2>
<p><em>Abstraction</em> is an omnipresent topic in software development.
Very broadly speaking, <em>abstraction</em> refers to the result (or
sometimes the action itself) of making something less detailed. In
programming specifically it refers to removing implementation specific
details. For instance, take a math package that offers a function or
method to calculate the average of a list of numbers. First it needs to
sum up all the numbers, then count how many numbers there are, before
dividing the sum by the count. When you use the <code>average</code>
function, you are using an abstraction, because all you do is call
<code>average()</code>. Well, in theory at least, but we’ll get to that
in a minute.</p>
<p>First, let’s talk about why it is important to talk about
abstraction. There are really two reasons. First, every time you
program, you create abstractions. The better defined these abstractions
are, the easier it will be to maintain the code. You should have a plan
for what functions or methods your code will provide. Ideally, the
abstractions you create will be consistent and make logical sense
(principle of least astonishment!). For instance, if you develop a
package to provide domain-specific math functions, then that package
should not contain functionality to do string manipulations.</p>
<p>Second, you are using abstractions every time you program. When you
use a module provided by your language of choice or developed by someone
else, you are using their abstractions. This means that there is a lot
that’s going on under the hood. When using an abstraction, you are
trusting that the abstraction is doing what it should be doing and what
you think it should be doing. And here is the thing, when earlier it
said you don’t need to know the implementation details and that it does
not matter to you, that’s not the complete truth. In fact, it does
matter because a) you depend on it doing what you expect it to be doing
and b) abstractions can <em>leak</em>.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="leaky-abstractions">Leaky Abstractions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#leaky-abstractions"></a>
</h3>
<p>The “Law of Leaky Abstractions” was coined by Joel Spolsky and states
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spolsky was a program manager for Microsoft Excel in the 90s, he
co-created StackOverflow and Trello, and had a blog <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/" class="external-link">Joel on Software</a> where he
wrote about programming. Some of his blog posts were also published as a
book and are still worth reading.</p>
<p>But what does it mean that all abstractions are leaky? What Spolsky
is describing with this law is the fact that as soon as an abstraction
is complex enough, the complexity of certain implementation details that
abstractions hide bubble up to the higher layers. To use a very simple
example, consider the following function that divides two number and
subtracts one from it:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb8">
<h3 class="code-label">PYTHON<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

</div>
<p>If you use this function and pass in 0 as the second argument you
will get a ZeroDivisionError. This means that the implementation
specific details (that num_1 is divided by num_2) cause an error that is
passed on to the next layer (your code). The abstraction is leaky. To be
able to avoid this error, you need to know the implementation details of
the function to then handle the division by 0 case in your code.</p>

<p>In this case, a Python script used for chemistry calculations yielded
different results depending on the operating system. Operating systems
sort files differently by default (some use alphabetic order, some use
the creation date, etc.). The Python script did not take this into
account and just used the list of files returned by Python’s functions
to get a list of all files in a directory without any further sorting.
Since the algorithm relied on a particular order of the files, it
returned different results when run on an operating system that sorted
files differently. The specifics of the operating system leaked through
the Python abstraction and into the script.</p>
<p>Another example is floating point arithmetic. When we are using
Python, we typically use the decimal system for calculations. However,
numbers are internally stored in a binary system (consisting of 1s and
0s). Not all decimal numbers can be represented as binary numbers. This
is similar to not being able to represent certain fractions like ⅓ as a
decimal number. 0.1 is a decimal number that can’t be represented as a
binary number (it would be a never ending number). This leads on the one
hand to rounding errors when your number get too small, on the other
hand you might encounter some special cases like the following:</p>

</h3>
<p>Leaky Abstractions are really tricky. First of all, you need to know
how an abstraction works to be able to handle a leaky abstraction. Often
leaky abstractions lead you down the rabbit hole of implementation
details in the search for the root cause of an issue. More importantly
though, it can be near impossible to know when an abstraction might leak
unless you know the implementation specifics of the abstraction. In the
case of the chemistry script, unless you have run into the issue of file
sorting before or are a very careful reader of documentation (and even
that won’t always save you), there is no way of predicting that there
might be an issue. This problem is compounded by the fact that the
number of existing abstractions increases constantly. The more packages
and frameworks there are to make the life of a developer easier, the
more abstractions there are, which means the greater the potential for a
leaky abstraction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A class should have only one reason to change.”</p>
<p>Robert C. Martin (2003), Agile Software Development: Principles,
Patterns, and Practices</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where you could replace “class” with “module” or “function.” This
principle is also expressed at: “Gather together the things that change
for the same reasons. Separate those things that change for different
reasons.” Basically what this means is that the things that belong
together should be together. For example, if your module is reading and
writing CSV files, then it should not also do math calculations. The
only reason for your module to change is if the format of the CSV files
changes, for instance.</p>
<p>While this in theory might seem straightforward, it can get pretty
tricky when you have functionality that depends on many different
interconnected factors. Sometimes, the question of what qualifies as a
“reason to change” needs to be reframed to not introduce too many new
complexities in an effort to reduce the “responsibility” of a
component.</p>

<p>Look at the following example and think about what the different
responsibilities of the class are.</p>

</div>
<p>In the above example, the <code>Student</code> class has three
different responsibilities: registering students, calculating the
results for a student, and sending an email to the student. This means
that it also has at least three reasons to change: if students need to
be registered differently, if the results of a student need to be
calculated differently, or if emails need to be sent out
differently.</p>
<p>The following code separates out those responsibilities into
different classes.</p>

<h3 class="code-label">PYTHON<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

<p>Now, each class has only one responsibility. The <code>Student</code>
class is used to manage student data. The <code>Registrar</code> class’
responsibility is to register students (and potentially unregister
them). The <code>EmailService</code> sends emails. A side effect of
applying the SRP is that each class can now potentially be used in a
different context (e.g. the <code>EmailService</code> could be extended
to send emails to faculty).</p>

<h1 id="layer-3-components-and-services">Layer 3: Components and Services<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#layer-3-components-and-services"></a>
</h1>
<p>We will not talk much about this layer as it highly depends on the
type of software you are developing. However, the basic principles we’ve
talked about before apply here as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>The responsibilities of your components or services should be
clearly defined. Each component or service should ideally handle a
specific task (e.g. analyze something or handle notifications, but not
do both). However, especially if you opt to set up distributed services
(which means that you have multiple applications running to handle
different aspects of your overall goal), it will greatly increase the
complexity of your applications. Sometimes, it’s the better (or only)
choice, but sometimes keeping it all in one application is preferable to
avoid too much complexity.</li>
<li>There should be clearly defined interfaces between components and
services. This means on the one hand that they should be well
documented, but on the other hand also that there is a limited number of
how a component or service can be interacted with. If there are 5
different ways of calling a service with only slight or no obvious
differences it makes it a lot harder to understand what the service does
and how it should be best used.</li>
<li>Input and output formats should be clearly defined and ideally use
common standards. What this means is that if there is a widely-accepted
format that you could use for your data, then use it rather than
creating your own. It will make it easier for other people to use your
code because they might already have data in the required format or at
least are familiar with it. It also means that the output of your code
will be easier to use in other programs.</li>
<li>Code should not be copy-pasted from one component to another. If you
find that two components need the same code, then a third component or
package should be extracted with the common code. Otherwise, the
likelihood of creating inconsistencies is a lot higher when you for
example change one component but don’t apply the change to the
other.</li>
<li>Your components or services should be loosely coupled, which means
pretty much the same as it means when we talk about loosely coupled
classes or modules. The components or services should know as little as
possible about each other’s implementation, and if service A is changed,
service B should not be required to change as well. Depending on the
type of application you are developing and your use case, there are
different technologies and concepts to achieve that such as event buses,
microservices, web services, or Functions as a Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a general rule, it’s typically a good strategy to start with the
KISS principle (keep it simple stupid) and then increase the complexity
as it becomes necessary. For instance, if you build a web application to
present data and you don’t know yet how many users you will have or how
much data, start with one app on one server. If it turns out that there
are too many requests for your application to handle, you can then start
thinking about extracting parts of the code into their own services.
However, if you already know that you’ll have enough requests to
potentially overwhelm one application, then you should design your
system in a way that will make it easy to scale it when needed.</p>

applied to all layers and many scenarios.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="code-with-intentionality">Code with Intentionality<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#code-with-intentionality"></a>
</h2>
<p>What this means is that every line of code you write, should be there
because it is needed, not because that’s how you have always done it,
that’s how you found it somewhere, or that’s how it is in the example.
You should understand each line you write and also understand the
consequences of it. To give a few scenarios that often result in coding
without intentionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>We all find solutions and examples on the internet and like to
copy-paste those because they solve a problem we encounter. However,
make sure you understand what you copy-paste. What does the code
actually do that you integrate into your code base? Do you understand
what happens in each line and in any given scenario?</li>
<li>Similarly, if you use an LLM to generate code, make sure you
understand the generated code. LLMs are a great tool but they are a
recipe for disaster if you blindly copy their solution without
understanding it.</li>
<li>IDEs are also a great tool that can generate code for you. But like
all the other scenarios, don’t just use IDE generated code without
understanding it.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a concrete example, consider exception handling. If you catch an
exception in your code, why are you doing that? What happens after you
catch an exception and does that make sense? Is the rest of the code
still executed and if so, would it still be possible to get sensible
results? If not, then maybe you should stop the execution at that point.
In contrast, if you decide not to catch an exception, what does that
mean for your code? WIll it error out? If so, does that make sense or
would it still be possible to get valid results if you would catch the
exception and continue?</p>
<p>Another example are dates. Dates are often used without considering
all the intricacies that they come with. When you display a date, which
timezone do you display? UTC? Local time? Your time? And do you show the
timezone when displaying it? And if you store dates, do you store which
timezone they are in? And does it matter?</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="consistency-is-key">Consistency is Key<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#consistency-is-key"></a>
</h2>
<p>No matter what aspect of your code, consistency is always a good
thing. Pick a code style and stick to it. Some languages like Python
come with a recommended code style, other languages have a number of
code styles in use. Google has their <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/" class="external-link">code style guidelines</a>
for different languages published if you want to see some examples. Be
consistent in how you name variables, functions, classes, methods, etc.
If you deviate from your naming patterns make sure it’s a conscious
decision and has a good reason. It will make understanding and
navigating your code a lot easier.</p>
<p>Consistency also applies to the structure of your application. The
more patterns repeat, the easier it is to understand an application. For
example, if you use a manager class to manage one type of object, make
sure to also create manager classes to manage other types of objects. If
you do it one way in one scenario and then a different way in another
scenario it becomes easily confusing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#documentation"></a>
</h2>
<p>There are many different types of documentation. Not all
documentation is or has to be written by the developer and not all
documentation is for the developer. Therefore, depending on your
project, the requirements for documentation might change with every
project as well as over time. The following list lists some common types
of documentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements documentation</li>
<li>Architecture/design documentation</li>
<li>Technical documentation
<ul>
<li>In-code documentation</li>
<li>API documentation</li>
<li>Development setup</li>
<li>Test documentation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Installation documentation</li>
<li>End-user documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>For many if not most researchers, providing all these types of
documentation for a project is not realistic. And often also not
necessary! If the code is meant for other researchers to run on their
data, we might not need elaborated test documentation or API
documentation. However, often at least some aspects of each type of
documentation should be written down. Maybe there is no full-blown
development setup documentation needed, but at least it should be
documented what the dependencies are that need to be installed before
the code can be run. Similarly, a full requirements documentation might
not be needed but it should be documented what problem the code is
supposed to solve.</p>
<p>One way to decide what documentation to write and how much is based
on the following two questions: - <strong>What is most helpful to
yourself?</strong> - <strong>If someone else would help you, what would
be most helpful to them?</strong></p>
<p>If you take these questions as basis for what documentation to write,
you’ll likely end up with a list that looks something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical documentation
<ul>
<li>In-code documentation</li>
<li>Development setup</li>
<li>API documentation</li>
<li>Architecture/design documentation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test documentation</li>
<li>Requirements documentation</li>
<li>Installation documentation</li>
<li>End-user documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>First you want to make sure you understand your own code. In-code
documentation (via comments) is your most powerful tool for this task.
Next, you probably want to document how you set up your development
environment. What programming language and version, what other
dependencies are needed. We have discussed tools how this can be made
easier (e.g. using Docker containers). A formal API documentation that
documents how the different functions and/or classes and methods can be
used will probably be most useful after that, along with an overview of
the architecture, the different components of your software. The order
of the last four will likely depend on the type of project and who the
main users of your code are. Maybe one sentence like “run the test in
this way…” will be enough as test documentation and maybe you already
have a paper that documents the requirements. Adjust the list above as
needed to your particular situation.</p>
<p>In summary, documentation enables yourself as well as other people to
reuse your code even when you forgot the details or if you have moved on
to different projects. It is a crucial part of software development.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="conventions">Conventions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conventions"></a>
</h2>
<p>Many communities have certain programming conventions, for example
regarding which code style they typically use, how they test software,
or how code is documented. Communities can, for example, be domain
specific, programming language specific, or technology specific. Often
you will be part of several communities, e.g. the Python community and
the computational biology community. Make sure you know the conventions
employed by the communities you are a part of and follow the conventions
unless you have a good reason not to (intentionality!). It will make it
a lot easier for other people in your community to understand the code
you write. Sometimes, there might be conflicting conventions in the
communities you are part of, in that case it makes sense to consider
which community is more likely to read your code or reuse it and use the
conventions of that community.</p>
<p>Let’s illustrate this point with the beloved car example. There are
certain things when driving a car that once you have learnt them you
won’t need to have explained to you again because conventions are in
place that it will be the same for all cars. You won’t need to read up
on how to open a door, how to use the turn signal, or how to use the
break. This is the same for all cars. No documentation is needed
(although there probably is some in the manual). Other things however,
like the entertainment system, vary from brand to brand, or from model
to model. For those, you need documentation to ensure users can use
them. And if you choose to deviate from the convention (let’s say you
design a Tesla and think how doors open needs to be redesigned), then
you definitely need documentation.</p>
